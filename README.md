This repository provides a set of libraries for privacy-preserving networking & 
internet applications written in rust.

The set of libraries supports mix networks (Tor, I2P, Nym), proxies, end-to-end
encryption without central authorities/PKI (Noise-based encryption protocols 
like lightning wire protocol, NTLS etc).

## Overview

The library provides three main components, structured as modules:
- **Network addresses** (sub-crate `cypheraddr`), which allow simple use of
    - Tor, Nym, I2P and other mix networks and SOCKS proxies
    - P2P addresses with node public keys
    - May be used in a way that prevents using DNS names (outside mixnet scope).
- **Noise protocol framework** (sub-crate `noise-framework`) for end-to-end
  encrypted network communications.
- **SOCKS5 client** (sub-crate `socks5-client`) for accessing Tor and other
  mixnets via proxy.

All the components has a minimal set of non-optional dependencies and short
compile times. For instance, SOCKS5 proxy and cyphernet addresses both have zero 
non-optional dependencies.

The library tries to minimize number of dependencies. Most of its functionality
is available via non-default features, like:
- `noise`: support for noise protocols;
- `mixnets`: supports for mixnet network addresses, including `tor`, `nym`, 
  `i2p` (may require additional crypto libraries for parsing public keys);
- `serde`: encoding for addresses types;
- `dns`: enable use of DNS names alongside IP addresses and mixnet names.

Network addresses provided by the library include the following types:
* `InetHost` - IP addr or DNS name
* `HostName` - IP, DNS, Tor, I2P, Nym host name (no port or proxy information)
* `NetAddr` - any type of host name + port information
* `PartialAddr` - any type of host name + optional port, which defaults to 
                  generic const if not provided
* `PeerAddr` - any of the above addresses + node public key for authentication
* `ProxiedHost` - host name + proxy (there are IP/DNS w/o proxy and with proxy)
* `ProxiedAddr` - any of the above addresses + proxy (thus IP/DNS is always 
                  proxied)
